# Memory Tile Pair Game

This project is personal and it is my first one on flutter.

I am aiming to make a memory game.

The game is simple. You are shown some tiles and you have to memorize the icons on them. Once you are ready the tiles are turned over (you can't see the icons anymore) and you have to tap on tiles that had the same icon and find the pairings.

The game is over when all the pairs have been found or when the user quits :(
